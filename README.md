# Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz Algorithm

Exercise 1 and 2 for Distributed Algorithms (IN4150), implementing the Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz algorithm for causal ordering
of point-to-point messages.

### Deadline: Friday 27 November

## Exercise 1B description:

Implement the Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz algorithm for causal ordering of point-to-point messages with Java/RMI. The implemented program should be truly distributed in that the it can be demonstrated to run across multiple physical machines.

## Exercise 2B description:
Implement Suzuki’s and Kasami’s algorithm for mutual exclusion in a distributed system with Java/RMI. The implemented program should be truly distributed in that the it can be demonstrated to run across multiple physical machines. The assignment can be split up into the following three part.
